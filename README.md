This artical is titled **WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING? ** but the content of the text puts the emphasis on the appropriateness of the name *engineer* rather than explaining the content of software engineering. The author interestingly pointed out that the name remained this way only because of convention, and there are discrepancies between the definition of engineering and the skills required for software engineering.
